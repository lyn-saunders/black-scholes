# A work-in-progress of my project for the University of St Andrews InvestSoc (Quant and Tech Sector).

In this project I aim to utilise finite difference methods (FDMs) such as the Forward Time Central Space (FTCS) and Crank-Nicolson methods to improve the Black-Scholes model for options pricing. So far I have looked into using these emthods to investigate both American and European options. The estimated finishing time for this project is the middle of April.
